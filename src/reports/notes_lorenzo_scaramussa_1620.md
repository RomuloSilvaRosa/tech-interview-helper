"""
We have a set of JSON files containing experiment results for various machine
learning models. Each JSON file has the following structure:


{
   "model_id": "unique-model-identifier", // UUID string
   "issuer": "email_of_@_the_experimenter.com",
   "experiment_date": "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ",  // ISO formatted timestamp
   "threshold_arr": [0., 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.99, 1.], // sorted array of probability thresholds, interval may vary between entries
   "recall_arr": [1., 0.98, 0.98, ..., 0.001, 0.] // array of recalls corresponding to each threshold
}




We need a script to perform the following tasks:


1. Find and parse the JSON files in the current working directory,
  validate the JSON structure ensuring the presence of required keys and
  correct formats for the values of issuer and and experiment_date.
2. For each model, identify the probability threshold that yields a recall
  value closest to 0.85.
3. If multiple thresholds result in the same closest recall, choose any among
  them.
4. Output a summary report showing, for each model:
  - model_id
  - issuer
  - optimal_threshold
  - closest_recall_value
